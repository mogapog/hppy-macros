Hppy macros is a linux macroing tool for automatizing linux commands.
You can schedule a macro to run at certain days of the weeks, and at certain hours.
It is an open source project ran by me (the creator) written in bash and python.

To install it, open a terminal in this directory (the "/hppymacro/" directory.) and then the following commands:

chmod +x hppy

Next, run:

./hppy -i

This will set up everything you need. The macros, the python scripts and this readme file will move to the directory "/etc/hppymacros".

Run hppy -h after the installation to see all the commands.

The hppy file itself will be located at "/usr/local/bin/"

Right now the hppy project is in a beta phase and a lot of things could and will change. Please report any bugs you find as this will help make the project better.

Thanks for reading.

Hppy version 0.1.0
